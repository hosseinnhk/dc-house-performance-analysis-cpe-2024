## Abstract
Leveraging advancements in power electronics, the adoption of Direct Current (dc) technology in net-Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs) is seen as a promising approach to boost energy efficiency. Emerging dc technology aims to reduce power losses by eliminating unnecessary conversions between dc and Alternating Current (ac). This paper thoroughly assesses the effectiveness of dc and hybrid dc (partial dc) topologies in comparison to conventional ac nZEBs. The hybrid solution integrates ac and dc networks and loads within the building, while the dc solution benefits from a purely dc internal electricity distribution network and exclusively dc loads. The study involves analyzing annual load profile data from 16 neighboring houses in Estonia, simulating their transition to nZEBs with dc, hybrid dc, and pure dc topologies. The study examines power conversion losses, the operational periods of power converters in relation to their maximum power capacity, and energy exchanges with the utility grid. Additionally, it explores the potential for creating energy communities based on the consumption patterns of these houses. The results indicate that pure dc nZEBs might not be as efficient as initially thought, especially when renewable resources are limited.
